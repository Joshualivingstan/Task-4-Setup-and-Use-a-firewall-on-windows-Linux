ðŸ§  Firewall Summary

A firewall filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of rules.

It can block/allow traffic based on IP addresses, port numbers, or protocols.

Example: Blocking port 23 prevents Telnet connections, which reduces exposure to certain attacks.

Allowing only essential services, like SSH, reduces the attack surface.
